## Overview
You will be controlling the inside of a dungeon, while enemies try breach and get from the entrance doors all the way to the dungeons heart. If a enemy achives their goal to get there your dungeon heart will lose power, if it is reduced to 0 you will lose. You can protect yourself by adding traps and buildings to fight off these enemies. However this costs gold which is only achieved by destroying a enemy. Some enemys may choose to go for your gold stash instead of your dungeon heart.

## Rules
Enemys will enter the dungeon to attack your dungeon heart if it is reduced to 0 you lose.
Not all enemys will prioritize your dungeon heart some will target your gold stash.
Not all enemys have the same amount of health or move at the same speed.
Build buildings and traps around your dungeon to destroy the invaders.
buildings and traps will cost gold relative to their dependency/effectivness.
If you survive round 10 then you will have repelled the invaders and you win.
